    <h2>To My Sunshine ☀️</h2>
    <div class="love-letter">
      <p>My Dearest Buki,</p>

      <p>I honestly don’t know how to fully describe how much you mean to me. But here I am, trying to turn my feelings into words—hoping this little page captures even a piece of what lives in my heart.</p>

      <p>You are not just my girlfriend. You are my peace. My softness in a hard world. My reason for smiling at nothing. My warmth in the cold. My calm after the storm. You are the little voice that reminds me that I’m capable, worthy, and loved even on the days when I forget.</p>

      <p>Since you came into my life, everything changed. Not in dramatic fireworks—but in gentle, beautiful ways. You’ve taught me patience, vulnerability, real love, and what it means to grow with someone—not just beside them. You've believed in me in moments when I doubted myself, and you’ve loved me through silences, smiles, and storms.</p>

      <p>I call you Sunshine not just because you light up every room you walk into—but because you’ve warmed my life in ways I can’t explain. I call you Buki because you are my precious gift. The one my heart chose and keeps choosing every day.</p>

      <p>This website might be simple, but it’s a small reflection of how much I adore you. Every word here, every picture, every page—is because you matter to me in ways I’ll spend forever trying to show you.</p>

      <p>I want a life where we make pancakes on lazy Sundays, slow dance to music only we can hear, laugh at the same inside jokes, and build a love that we both feel safe and free in. That’s the life I see with you, Buki.</p>

      <p>No matter where the world takes us, just know: you’ll always be the center of my heart, the rhythm in my days, and the one I’m most thankful for.</p>

      <p>I love you deeply, endlessly, and gently.</p>

      <p>Forever yours, <br>
      Collins 💌</p>

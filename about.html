    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>We met in 2023 and it has been a moment and a half ever since. It started with laughs, late-night chats, and little things that turned into big feelings. Weâ€™ve made memories in cafÃ©s, in texts, on walks, and in shared playlists. We talk about dreams, about forever, and sometimes about Amani and Imani. It's not just love. Itâ€™s us.</p>
    <p>We love Minute Maid, crispy chicken, surprise flowers, and goofy letters. We dream out loud and love out loud. This is our journey â€” soft, silly, sacred.</p>

        She's a firebrand girl from CUEA, full of warmth, wit, and wisdom. A lover, a deep feeler, a Pinterest enthusiast who can turn a vibe into an aesthetic. She's studying social work and already leaving her mark on hearts. Samantha is joy with a soft laugh and a serious side that builds futures. Maria, the girl who makes forever feel possible.

        Heâ€™s the quiet storm behind it all. A mover, a planner, a guy who says what he means and means what he builds. Collins Kibet loves big and dreams bigger. He moves us through life, through love, and through this thing weâ€™re writing together. Heâ€™s the guy behind the letters, the code, and the love notes with extra space between lines. Still choosing her, still choosing this.
